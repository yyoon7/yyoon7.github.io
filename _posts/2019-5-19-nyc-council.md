to require buildings of more than 25,000 square feet to curb carbon emissions is enacted. This local law, known to be [the first of its kind worldwide](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-city-carbon-emissions-from-trump-tower-and-other-buildings-80-percent/), requires the existing buildings in the New York City, including the infamous Trump Tower, to cut carbon emssions by 40 percent by 2030 and by 80 percent by 2050. While President Trump has denied the existence of climate change and announced the United States' [withdrawal from the Paris Agreement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-trump-paris-climate-accord), his real estate properties in the Big Apple will be held accountable for their carbon emissions.

> "Reports show Trump Tower and other properties are among the dirtiest emitters in the Big Apple. These are the bad actors we need to hold accountable, because their emissions make everyone's air dirtier, fuel more violent weather and put the future of New York City in jeopardy." - New York City Council Member [Costa Constantinides](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-city-carbon-emissions-from-trump-tower-and-other-buildings-80-percent/)
