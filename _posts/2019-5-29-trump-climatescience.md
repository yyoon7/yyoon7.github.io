The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/us/politics/trump-climate-science.html) that the Trump administration will soon complete the legal rollback of the Obama administration's efforts to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. 

On top of this process, the White House seeks to undermine the very science (climate science), on which the existing climate change laws and policies rest, by rewriting the [National Climate Assessment](https://www.globalchange.gov/nca4) without projection of worst-case scenarios. 

Many claim that the Trump administration intends to use a rewritten climate assessment as evidence when its opponents challenge the rollback in court.
